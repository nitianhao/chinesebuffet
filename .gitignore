Make final polish improvements to Social & Community Services output (keep deterministic + cheap, JSON-only):

1) SUMMARY VERB / PHRASING CLEANUP
Avoid robotic phrasing like "Lists book exchanges..."
Use one of these two deterministic sentence variants for the bucket-type sentence (pick by hash buffetId % 2):
A) "Includes {typePhraseA} and {typePhraseB}."
B) "Nearby options include {typePhraseA} and {typePhraseB}."
Do not use the verb "Lists".

2) PUBLIC_BOOKCASE FALLBACK CONSISTENCY
When category === "public_bookcase" and name is null:
- If the same bucket already contains an item whose normalizedName == "little free library":
  fallback name => "Little Free Library (book exchange)"
- Else fallback name => "Book exchange"
This prevents mixing branded vs generic names awkwardly.

3) RANGE ROUNDING (LESS PRECISE LOOK)
For rangeText in feet, round to nearest 50 ft (or 100 ft) instead of exact tens:
- e.g., 2890 -> 2900
Keep item-level distanceText logic unchanged.

4) SINGLE-ITEM SUMMARY HEDGE REMOVAL + CONTACT SENTENCE
Single-item template should not say "about ~X" (double hedge).
Use: "1 social & community service is listed {nearestDistanceText} from the buffet."
If hasWebsite/hasPhone in the single item:
- hasWebsite only => "A website link is available."
- hasPhone only => "A phone number is available."
- both => "Website and phone details are available."
If neither, omit the second sentence unless hasHours => "Hours may vary."

5) OPTIONAL: COUNT BY TYPE WHEN poiCount>=3 AND EXACTLY 2 BUCKETS
Compute in code: "{nA} {typePhraseA} and {nB} {typePhraseB}"
Then bucket-type sentence becomes:
- "Includes {nA} {typePhraseA} and {nB} {typePhraseB}."
(Only when poiCount>=3, else keep the simpler sentence.)

Implement these changes in the TypeScript/tsx script:
- Adjust preprocessing + computed fields passed to Groq (type counts, hasLFLInBucket).
- Update minimal Groq prompt rules accordingly.
Return the full updated script.
